MTurk Hit Cookie Blocker
=============================

Firefox extension that blocks the "Hit-*" cookies that MTurk creates when accepting HITs, which can often lead to "400 Bad Request - Cookie Too Large" errors. More info [here](https://forum.turkerview.com/threads/mturk-cookies-400-bad-request-errors.2375/).

I'm not aware of any extensions for Firefox that can block these cookies, so hopefully this will help anyone turking on Firefox.
